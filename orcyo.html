    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <img src="bragestats.png" alt="">
      <p>Orcyo is one of the leading League of Legends players in Norwegian history. Once in a while a talent appears that has the mechanics of a god, and the game knowledge of a retarded sea lion. In this case, the player was Orcyo.<br>Orcyo doesn't only have godlike stats in League of Legends. He is also a prominent player in several other games, like Nidhogg, Chivalry and all FPS'. <br> Some might say that he is shit due to his top KDA being 0.05 at best, but his mom tells him that he will be the next Dyrone. He still believes his mother's lies.</p>

      <h2>League of Legends Career</h2>
      <p>Orcyo started his League of Legends career early 2011. He used to play with this shitty kid whose name is Klovman45. Due to him queueing with Klovman45, he didn't stop sucking dick for a couple of years. It was only after Klovman45 decided to throw away his life playing football in 2013 that Orcyo finally started playing properly. <br> Orcyo had previously started queueing with inGameToasted, a norwegian League of Legends pro, and in 2013 they started queueing more and more together. Orcyo got carried really hard for a couple of months, until inGameToasted decided to join a team and get Diamond in Ranked 5's. Orcyo wasn't good enough to make the team. <br> During the 9 months inGameToasted played Ranked 5's, Orcyo would play Dota 2; a shitty-ass clone that sucks major dick. Due to his playtime in Dota, Orcyo would then start sucking even more dick in LoL. He would go back to LoL and continue to suck dick until 2016 when he decided to git gud. He then climbed all the way to Platinum 2, only to steal Toasted's account and smurf. <br> During his "climbing" period, Orcyo would become a Draven OTP. This happened because he is such a Tyler1 fanboy, and he can't think for himself. Fortunately for him, shitty players can't handle Draven, and him having a shitty ELO would cause him to carry and think that he is good. <br> Nowadays Orcyo only plays LoL with his brother and his shitty friends, or with Toasted when they are extremely bored and Orcyo doesn't have enough cash to buy a cool game. </p>

    <h1>Other Talents</h1>
    <p>Orcyo doesn't have any other talents, because he sucks dick in all other video games. He is pretty good at downing beers and stuffing snus in his lip though. <br> He is also a pretty cool person overall, even when he refuses to be social at any time.</p>
